This cron script takes a GeoRSS feed from Foursquare, grabs the latest check-ins and dumps them into a MySQL database.  The script uses the Yahoo Placefinder API to reverse geocode your coordinates and fill in city, state and country.


TO INSTALL
- Download contents to your webserver
- Dump the SQL file to your MySQL database to create the required tables
- Edit config.inc and insert your Foursquare ID and database connections
- Schedule cron.php to run at an interval you prefer

MAPS
- Once you have built your database you can load the states.php and world.php files to display aggregated locations of where you have been


FUTURE PLANS
- Render a Google Map of all of the cities you have visited
- Create a moving map of your check-ins
- Move beyond Foursquare? - need ideas
